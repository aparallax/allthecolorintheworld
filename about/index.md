title: All the Color in the World
---

*All the Color in the World* was developed by Christopher Adams and Jun Yang for
*[The Artist, his Collaborators, their Exhibition, and three Venues]*, which
runs from 2021/02/06 to 2021/03/31 at [MoCA Taipei].

*All the Color in the World* is:

* A series of [three digital prints] (119Ã—84 cm) exhibited at MoCA Taipei.
* A series of [three NFTs] listed on OpenSea.
* A website at [allthecolorintheworld.com].
* A [public talk] by Adams and Yang at MoCA Taipei on 2021/03/13.

Adams and Yang are engaged in a long-term conversation about the artist, the
original, the edition, and the digital. Art history has taken us through
one-offs, prints, copies, ready-mades, and now non-fungible tokens.

We'd only do this for *All the Color in the World*.
